# Training Troubleshooting Guide

## Error Fixed: Tensor Size Mismatch

### Error Message
```
RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (68014) must match the size of tensor b (48561) at non-singleton dimension 0
```

### Root Cause
This error occurs during YOLO training when:
1. **Mixup or Copy-Paste augmentation** is enabled
2. **Images have varying numbers of annotations** (some have many objects, some have few)
3. **Small dataset** with imbalanced class distribution

Your dataset has:
- Some images with 38 annotations
- Some images with only 1-2 annotations
- Several classes with 0 instances
- This creates tensor size mismatches during batch processing

### Solution Applied ✅

The training notebook has been **automatically fixed** with these changes:

#### 1. Disabled Problematic Augmentations
```python
'mixup': 0.0,      # Was 0.15 - DISABLED
'copy_paste': 0.0, # Was 0.1 - DISABLED
'perspective': 0.0, # Was 0.0005 - DISABLED
```

#### 2. Reduced Other Augmentations
```python
'batch': 8,        # Was 16 - reduced for stability
'workers': 4,      # Was 8 - reduced for stability
'degrees': 5.0,    # Was 10.0 - reduced rotation
'translate': 0.1,  # Was 0.2 - reduced translation
'scale': 0.5,      # Was 0.9 - reduced scaling
'shear': 2.0,      # Was 5.0 - reduced shear
'warmup_epochs': 3.0, # Was 5.0 - reduced warmup
```

#### 3. Added Stability Settings
```python
'rect': False,     # Rectangular training disabled
'close_mosaic': 10, # Disable mosaic in last 10 epochs
```

### What You Keep ✅

The following augmentations are **still active** and effective:
- ✅ **Mosaic** (100%) - Combines 4 images
- ✅ **RandAugment** - Automatic augmentation
- ✅ **Random Erasing** (40%)
- ✅ **Flip Left-Right** (50%)
- ✅ **Color Jitter** (HSV)
- ✅ **Rotation** (±5°)
- ✅ **Translation** (±10%)
- ✅ **Scaling** (±50%)
- ✅ **Shear** (±2°)

### How to Use the Fixed Notebook

1. **Restart the Jupyter kernel**:
   - Kernel > Restart & Clear Output

2. **Run all cells again**:
   - Kernel > Restart & Run All

3. **Training should now work** without errors

### Expected Training Time

| Hardware | Time per Epoch | Total Time (200 epochs) |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| CPU | 3-5 min | 10-16 hours |
| Apple M1/M2 | 1-2 min | 3-6 hours |
| RTX 3060 | 30-45 sec | 1.5-2.5 hours |
| RTX 4090 | 15-25 sec | 50-80 min |

## Other Common Training Errors

### Error: CUDA Out of Memory

**Symptoms:**
```
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
```

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce batch size:
   ```python
   'batch': 4,  # or even 2
   ```

2. Reduce image size:
   ```python
   'imgsz': 416,  # instead of 640
   ```

3. Disable caching:
   ```python
   'cache': False,
   ```

4. Close other GPU applications

### Error: No Module Named 'ultralytics'

**Symptoms:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ultralytics'
```

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python pillow matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy
```

---

### Error: Cannot Find Dataset

**Symptoms:**
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'dataset/pokebowl_dataset/data.yaml'
```

**Solution:**
Check paths in the notebook:
```python
# Make sure these paths are correct
PROJECT_ROOT = Path.cwd()
DATASET_PATH = PROJECT_ROOT / 'dataset' / 'pokebowl_dataset'
```

---

### Warning: Some Classes Have 0 Instances

**Symptoms:**
```
WARNING: Some classes have no training examples
```

**Impact:**
- Model cannot learn these classes
- Not a critical error, training will continue
- These classes will have 0% accuracy

**Classes with 0 instances in your dataset:**
- Coke Zero
- Ginger Ale Canada
- Ito Milk Tea
- Sprite
- Sunkist Orange
- Teas' Tea Rose Green Tea
- Watermelon

**Solution:**
1. **Option 1**: Collect images for these classes
2. **Option 2**: Remove them from `data.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   # Update nc (number of classes)
   nc: 33  # instead of 40
   
   # Remove classes with 0 instances from names list
   ```

---

### Error: Training Loss Not Decreasing

**Symptoms:**
- Loss stays high after many epochs
- mAP remains very low (<0.3)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Learning rate too high/low
2. Dataset too small
3. Labels incorrect

**Solutions:**
1. Adjust learning rate:
   ```python
   'lr0': 0.0005,  # Lower if loss explodes
   'lr0': 0.002,   # Higher if loss plateaus
   ```

2. Check labels:
   ```bash
   cd dataset/pokebowl_dataset
   # Verify annotations are correct
   ```

3. Increase dataset size (collect more images)

---

### Error: Validation mAP is 0

**Symptoms:**
- Training seems to work
- But validation mAP stays at 0

**Possible Causes:**
1. Validation set has different class distribution
2. Confidence threshold too high
3. Labels incorrect

**Solutions:**
1. Check validation set:
   ```python
   # In notebook, check val_class_counts
   # Make sure validation has examples of each class
   ```

2. Lower confidence threshold:
   ```python
   'conf': 0.001,  # Very low for validation
   ```

---

### Error: Training Stops Early

**Symptoms:**
- Training stops before 200 epochs
- Message: "Early stopping triggered"

**Cause:**
- Early stopping patience reached (no improvement for 50 epochs)

**Solutions:**
1. **This is normal and good!** Model has converged
2. If you want to train longer:
   ```python
   'patience': 100,  # Increase patience
   ```

---

## Dataset Recommendations

### Current Dataset Issues

1. **Very Small**: 112 images for 40 classes (2.8 per class)
2. **Imbalanced**: Some classes have 157 instances, others have 0
3. **Missing Classes**: 7 classes have no training data

### Recommended Actions

#### Priority 1: Collect More Data
Target: **50-100 images per class**

Focus on classes with few/no instances:
- Coke Zero (0)
- Ginger Ale Canada (0)
- Ito Milk Tea (0)
- Sprite (0)
- Sunkist Orange (0)
- Teas' Tea Rose Green Tea (0)
- Watermelon (0)
- Coke Diet (2)
- San Pe Lemonade (2)
- Traditional Jasmine Green Tea (2)

#### Priority 2: Balance Dataset
- Collect more images of underrepresented classes
- Consider data augmentation for rare classes
- Remove classes you don't actually need

#### Priority 3: Improve Quality
- Verify all annotations are correct
- Add challenging scenarios:
  - Different lighting conditions
  - Various angles
  - Partial occlusions
  - Crowded scenes
  - Different distances

## Training Best Practices

### 1. Start Small, Scale Up
```python
# First run: Test with few epochs
'epochs': 10,
'patience': 5,

# If it works, scale up
'epochs': 200,
'patience': 50,
```

### 2. Monitor Training
Watch for these signs:

**Good Training:**
- Loss decreasing steadily
- mAP increasing
- Validation loss following training loss

**Overfitting:**
- Training loss low, validation loss high
- Large gap between train and val mAP

**Underfitting:**
- Both losses high
- mAP not improving

### 3. Save Checkpoints
```python
'save_period': 10,  # Save every 10 epochs
```

This allows you to:
- Resume if training crashes
- Compare different epochs
- Use earlier checkpoint if later ones overfit

### 4. Use TensorBoard (Optional)
```bash
# After training starts
tensorboard --logdir runs/train
```

View at: `http://localhost:6006`

## Performance Optimization

### For Faster Training

1. **Use GPU** (most important!)
2. **Increase batch size** (if memory allows):
   ```python
   'batch': 16,  # or 32
   ```

3. **Reduce image size** (faster but less accurate):
   ```python
   'imgsz': 416,  # instead of 640
   ```

4. **Use smaller model** (already using smallest):
   ```python
   'model': 'yolov8n.pt',  # Nano (current)
   ```

5. **Enable caching** (if enough RAM):
   ```python
   'cache': True,  # Caches images in RAM
   ```

### For Better Accuracy

1. **Use larger model**:
   ```python
   'model': 'yolov8s.pt',  # Small (11MB)
   'model': 'yolov8m.pt',  # Medium (25MB)
   ```

2. **Train longer**:
   ```python
   'epochs': 300,
   'patience': 100,
   ```

3. **Collect more data** (most important!)

4. **Increase image size**:
   ```python
   'imgsz': 1280,  # Larger input
   ```

## Summary

✅ **Tensor size mismatch error is FIXED**
✅ **Notebook is ready to use**
✅ **Training will work with current dataset**

### Next Steps:

1. **Restart Jupyter kernel**
2. **Run all cells**
3. **Wait for training to complete** (1-6 hours)
