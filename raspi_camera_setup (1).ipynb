        "- Goal: make the current Raspberry Pi 5 + camera + AI hat setup physically smaller and cleaner without redesigning a brand new computer.\n",
        "- Strategy: keep an off\u2011the\u2011shelf compute module (e.g. Raspberry Pi Compute Module / Jetson Orin Nano module / Pi 5 equivalent brain) and design a **custom carrier board** that:\n",
        "  - removes unused ports (extra USB, HDMI, GPIO headers, etc.)\n",
        "  - keeps only camera CSI connector, power in, 1x USB for setup, cooling header, and AI accelerator header\n",
        "  - fits in a compact 3D\u2011printed enclosure.\n",
        "- What the vendor actually does:\n",
        "  1. electrical layout for a 2\u2011 or 4\u2011layer carrier PCB\n",
        "  2. basic enclosure model (3D printed or PLA/ABS block)\n",

        "  - production\u2011ready documentation\n",
        "  - full rewrite of firmware/drivers\n",
        "- Why it can hit ~$600\u2011$900 total:\n",
        "  - You are NOT asking them to redesign the CPU, RAM, DDR traces, PCIe, etc. You are saying: \u201cTreat the compute module like a black box, just build us a minimal breakout board around it so the whole unit is smaller and only has what we need.\u201d\n",
        "- When to ask for this quote:\n",
        "  - early demo for investors / pilot in one restaurant\n",
        "  - you only need 1\u20132 working boxes, not mass production.\n",

        "- Goal: turn the prototype into a real product SKU that is manufacturable, reliable, thermally stable, and documented.\n",
        "- Strategy:\n",
        "  - fully custom PCB with integrated compute, AI accelerator, camera interface, storage, power regulation\n",
        "  - enclosure designed for durability (machined aluminum or injection\u2011mold\u2011ready geometry)\n",
        "  - thermal solution (fan or passive sink) validated for 24/7 uptime in a hot kitchen\n",
        "  - bring\u2011up of Linux image and drivers so it boots into your app.\n",

        "  3. 1\u20132 assembled prototypes\n",
        "  4. Power + thermal test notes\n",
        "  5. Roadmap for EMC/FCC compliance\n",
        "- Why the cost jumps:\n",
        "  - High\u2011speed layout around CPU and AI accelerator is nontrivial, and they own some electrical risk.\n",
        "  - You are asking them to create *your* hardware platform, not a Raspberry Pi anymore.\n",
        "- When to ask for this quote:\n",
        "  - you want something you can put in front of restaurant managers or early customers as \"our device\"\n",
